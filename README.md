# TelegramAssistant
Telegram assistant using python-telegram-bot; initial use: medication reminder

Update:
Project was intended to regularly remind me via telegram messages to take my
medication. Running the bot on a raspberry pi worked out for quite a while,
but ultimately the project was abandoned because apple's ihealth app provides
a good service for this kind of task.
